# environmental variables (like PATH), which makes it difficult to track down
# where both Python and ffmpeg(1) might be.  These same processes also have
# their locale set to C.  This implies a default ASCII file encoding, which
# causes some scripts to refuse to run (since many assume a more Unicode-
# friendly view of the world somewhere in their code).
